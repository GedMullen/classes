## Exercises

1 . Complete Week 1 exercises using [week1exercises.php](https://gist.github.com/GedMullen/fa29fe3338a7582dbf77) and [surname.php](https://gist.github.com/GedMullen/140f12537a67b8e657fa). Make sure you do this in your "week1exercises" project on Ygritte. 
<br> 2 . Create a separate a table "users" in your own database using [users.sql](https://gist.github.com/GedMullen/11312ef28b66bf70eedf). Execute the SQL script using the following command:
```
mysql -t -u student < users.sql
```
<br> 3 . Create a "working_example" project on Ygritte and create a form that allows the user to enter in a user id and password. The page should then check the user id and password against the data that is stored in the users table and indicate to the user if the login attempt was successful.
<br> 4 . Add functionality to your site by allowing the user to register. This will involve capturing the name of the user and user password and inserting the information into the users table.
<br> 5 . Create a profile page that allows the user to see the information that they entered when they registered.
<br> 6 . Allow the users to change their profile information.
<br> 7 . Look at [PHP Sessions](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_sessions.asp). Add session management to your site.

## Exercises

The following exercises are designed to help you refamiliarise yourself with PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS. You should use [mysqlexample.php](https://gist.github.com/GedMullen/f58ea879c98ada9ca055) and the tutorials above as a starting point.

1 . Create an eclipse project on Ygritte called "week1exercises" and include the answers to the following exercises in this project. 
<br> 2 . Create a PHP file that generates a HTML table that details the top 10 salaries in the employees database (hint - use ORDER BY and LIMIT 10). You will need to join the EMPLOYEES and SALARIES tables.
<br> 3 . Add styling to the page generated by exercise 2.
<br> 4 . Create a form that allows the user to enter in a surname and submit it to the server. The server must then return the first 10 occurrences of the given surname in the employees database.
<br> 5 . Add more complexity to the exercises above if you have time.
