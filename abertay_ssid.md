## Exercises

The following exercises are designed to help you refamiliarise yourself with PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS. You should use [mysqlexample.php](https://gist.github.com/GedMullen/f58ea879c98ada9ca055) and the tutorials above as a starting point.

1 . Create an eclipse project on Ygritte called "week1exercises" and include the answers to the following exercises in this project. 
2 . Create a PHP file that generates a HTML table that details the top 10 salaries in the employees database (hint - use ORDER BY and LIMIT 10). You will need to join the EMPLOYEES and SALARIES tables.
3 . Add styling to the page generated by exercise 1.
4 . Create a form that allows the user to enter in a surname and submit it to the server. The server must then return the first 10 occurrences of that surname in the employees database.
