## Exercises

1 . Create a project called "xmlexercises" in eclipse on Ygritte and create an XML file that contains the xml data you identified in Exercise 2 in Week 1. You should create a DTD for this XML file in a separate file and make sure that the DTD file validates your XML file appropriately. 
<br> 2 . Add another 2 Invoice elements to the invoice.xml file in the XMLExamples project in Eclipse that contains different data and a date in a UK format. Make sure that the XML file still validates against the invoice.dtd file. 
<br> 3 . Modify the invoice.xml and invoice.dtd files in the XMLExamples project in eclipse so that a zip OR postcode can be specified. Add another Invoice element to test your modification.

## Exercises

1 . In groups create an XML document called "teams.xml" on Ygritte that represents the following [data](http://www.football-league.co.uk/sky-bet-championship/league-table/) (just create data for the first three teams as an example.) The XML document is to be regularly updated and provided to partner sites (such as the BBC) to display the latest league table.
<br>2 . In your groups research and identify a similar data source to that identified in Exercise 1. Create an example XML structure for the data source and present it to the class.
